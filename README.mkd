SudokuSolver
=========================

Simple command line utility and java components for solving 4-, or 9-, 16-[Sudoku][] puzzles.
The solver is theoretically already capable of handling boards larger than 16, though it 
is untested.

## Downloading

To download, you can clone the source from GitHub:

    $ git clone git@github.com:creitz/SudokuSolver.git
    $ cd SudokuSolver


## Compiling

Once in the cloned directory, run the following commands to create a bin/ directory and compile.

	$ mkdir bin
	$ javac -d bin/ src/com/creitz/sudokusolver/*

## Running from Command Line

	$ cd bin/
	$ java com/creitz/sudokusolver/SudokuSolver /path/to/file
	
The /path/to/file should be replaced by the path to the file containing a sudoku board you wish to solve.
The solver expects a board formatted as such:

```
9
*3***7***
2***56*1*
***19****
*59***8**
3*******5
**6***79*
****41***
*2*83***7
***2***6*
```

The *'s indicate an empty square in the board, and the numbers are the values for filled squares.
The 9 on the first line indicates that the board will be a 9x9.  If you wish to solve a 4x4, the 
file could containing the following:

```
4
3*1*
*12*
****
13*2
```

Or for a 16x16:

```
16
****D*C*3*5**81A
1*F49*GEDC**6**3
*D*5***A*9*27C**
8****F2**16***4*
*4*********52**E
**16****FD*E**GC
*C*****8*3*41*7*
***F*31*G**A*48B
******8G*4*1*E**
*F***69*A5B**GC1
*B9*****8****237
D****CB*62G7****
*AC**D3*4*F*G**5
2*4***71***6**ED
***389**1G2BCA**
**G1CB**5E**379*

```

For grid sizes larger than 9x9, the integers must be single-digit (i.e. use hex for 16x16).

## Using the Components

To create a SudokuSolver object and solve a sudoku, you can do the following

```java
	SudokuSolver solver = new SudokuSolver("filename");
	if (solver.solve()) {
		Grid solutionGrid = solver.getGrid();
		ArrayList<Square> solvedSquares = solutionGrid.getSquares();
		
		/*
		* Do whatever you'd like with the squares
		*/
		
	} else {
		System.out.println("Board does not have a unique solution.");
	}
```

Alternatively, you can create a grid programmatically instead of with a file, like so:

```java
Grid grid = new Grid(gridSize);
for (int row = 0; row < gridSize; row++) {
		for (int col = 0; col < gridSize; col++) {
			if (squareShouldHaveAValue) {
				grid.setValueAtCoords(row, col, someValue);
			}
		}
	} 
}
SudokuSolver solver = new SudokuSolver(grid);
solver.solve();
solver.getGrid();
```

A square object's value can be retrieved, for example, by 

```java
Square firstSquare = solvedSquares.get(0);
int firstValue = firstSquare.getValue();
```

Alternatively, you can query for the value at a given coordinate

```java
solutionGrid.getValueAtLocation(0, 0);
```

The top row is row 0, beneath that is row 1, then row 2, etc.
The left-most column is column 0, then column 1, etc.
The ArrayList of squares that is returned by ```getSquares()``` is a wrapped
ArrayList, so the first 9 elements are the squares in the top row, then 
the next 9 elements are, from left to right, the squares in the next row
from the top.  

So, for example, to retrieve the value of the middle square in the top right 
quadrant, you could do:

```java
solutionGrid.getValueAtLocation(1, 7);
```

or:

```java
solvedSquares.get(16);
```
